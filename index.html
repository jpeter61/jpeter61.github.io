        <h1>Hi! I'm Jamie Peterson</h1>
        <h3>
            I am a senior at Eastern Michigan University majoring in applied 
            computer science with a minor in management. Currently I am working
            for The Honors College at EMU as a Computing Fellow. The role includes 
            full-stack web development, talking to clients, and the creation of 
            documentation.

            More About Me
        </h2>
        <p>
           I spend most of my time learning not only in the classroom, but outside 
           as well. It's not always cool new programing technologies. Sometimes itâ€™s 
           about how films are made to elicit emotional responses, how to communicate 
           better with strangers, or a new philosophy on life. I do this to both 
           grow myself and to become the type of person that inspires others to 
           grow and excel as well. Helping people gives me satisfaction and makes 
           me feel complete. That is why I want to eventually become a manager.
