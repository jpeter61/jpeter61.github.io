        <h1>Hi! I'm Jamie Peterson</h1>

            More About Me
        </h2>
        <p>
            My favorite thing about programming is building solutions to problems
            from the perspective of the user. I believe that an environment where 
            there is constant communication between programmers and users makes 
            both a better product and a rewarding expierence for those working on it.
